# Arduino_Bluetooth_HC-06_module

The goal is this project to use the HC-06 module for controlling Arduino via Bluetooth communication
sending text commands from the the HC-06 module (using the software terminal Cool Term), and also sending text from the Arduino back to the HC-06 module.

The code was tested with both the ATmega1284p and the ATme644p microncontrollers and with the Arduino MEGA also. It always worked well.
